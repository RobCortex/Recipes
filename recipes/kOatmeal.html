 <div class="ingredients">
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
     <li>2 tablespoon ground flaxseed</li>
     <li>2 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
     <li>2 tablespoon unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
     <li>2 tablespoon granulated sweetener of choice</li>
     <li>1/2 cup hot liquid of choice (be it water, almond milk, etc.)</li>
     <li>1/2 cup cold liquid of choice (I prefer soy milk or unsweetend cashew milk)</li>
  </ul>
 </div>

 <div class="steps">
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your dry ingredients to a small mixing bowl and mix them well.</li>
        <li>Add half a cup of hot water or liquid of choice and mix it like mad. It should be EXTRA THICC, and then you can add your cold liquid of choice and mix it until it's even MORE THICC, and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add toppings and mix-ins of your choice.</li>
        <li>That's it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: You can also add an extra 2 tablespoons of liquid and leave it overnight in a refrigerator.</p>

    <p>Pro Tip: If you don't have shredded coconut or if the texture is too runny, try adding extra ground flaxseed.</p>
